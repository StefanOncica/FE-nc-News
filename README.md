## NorthCoders News Website - Front-end

After 10 weeks of intense learning and starting from zero experience, I have managed to create a website ! See below the hosting link: 
https://newsarticlesprojectnorthcodersstefanoncica.netlify.app/home
Please note it will take about 50sec to load the first time.  

This repo is the front-end part for the NC News project.
The back-end repo can be found here: https://github.com/StefanOncica/Backend-Northcoders-News


The Website has the following functionalities:

1. View a list of all articles
2. View an individual article
3. View a list of comments associated with an article
4. Vote on an article
5. Post a new comment to an existing article
6. Delete comments
7. View a separate page for each topic with a list of related articles
8. Sort articles


Website structure and planning can be seen here: https://excalidraw.com/#json=2BKF10pEQkTyLh6sdGYv0,COHymao0o1B9RZsDWeufqg

This portfolio project was created as part of a Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering provided by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/)
